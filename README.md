<h2 id="tests">Available Methods</h2>

 <h3 id="Amortization">Amortization<br>

 <code class="highlight">finance.AM(principal, rate, total number of payments, [type]);</code></h3>

 <p>Amortization is the paying off of debt with a fixed repayment schedule in regular installments over a period of time.<sup><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp" target="_blank">1</a></sup></p>

 <p>For total number of payments which are entered as years, <code>[type]</code> takes a <code>0</code>, whereas for months <code>[type]</code> takes a <code>1</code>.</p>

 <pre><code>#Total Number of Payments Type = Years
 // e.g., If principal is $20,000, rate is 7.5%, total number of payments is 5, and payment type is 0 (years), monthly payment is $400.76.

 finance.AM(20000, 7.5, 5, 0);
 => 400.76

 #Total Number of Payments Type = Months
 // e.g.,If principal is $20,000, rate is 7.5%, total number of payments is 60, and payment type is 1 (months), monthly payment is $400.76.

 finance.AM(20000, 7.5, 60, 1);

 <pre><code>// e.g., If the beginning value is $10,000, the ending value is $19,500, and the number of periods is 3, the CAGR is 24.93%.

 finance.CAGR(10000, 19500, 3);
 => 24.93</code></pre>

 <h3 id="CI">Compound Interest (CI)<br>

 finance.DF(10, 6);
 => [1, 0.91, 0.827, 0.752, 0.684]</code></pre>

 <h3 id="FV">Future Value (FV)<br>

 <code class="highlight">finance.FV(rate, cash flow, number of periods);</code></h3>

 <p><code>[cash flows]</code> takes any number of projected cash flows.</p>

 <pre><code>#Even Cash Flows
 // e.g., Because even cash flows have the same inflow during each period, we set 'number of periods' to '0.' If initial investment is -$105 and the annual cash flow is $25, the payback period is 4.2 years.

 finance.PP(0, -105, 25);
 => 4.2

 #Uneven Cash Flows
 // e.g., If number of periods is 5, initial investment is -$50, and the cash flows are $10, $13, $16, $19, and $22 for each year, the payback period is 3.42 years.
